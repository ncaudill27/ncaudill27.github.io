For my Rails project, Oss Combate, I decided to make a jiu jitsu tournament finder much like [smoothcomp](https://smoothcomp.com/en). Unforntunately I missed the mark by quite a bit. What I did achieve was to further my understanding of Ruby on Rails. Building a project from scratch like this helped me really dig into the project structure/organization.

Moving forward with a deeper knowledge of the basics it's easy to see how building out a larger scale application is simplified by keeping with convention over configuration. Allowing Rails to handle the dull work leaving the developer open to ideate functionality or UX. Finishing this project helps build the confidence that I understand what all the powerful Rails magic is doing behind the scenes.

Oss Combate is nowhere near where I'd like it to be currently. I see this an upside though. Having to branch off and downsize from a higher complexity starting plan means I already have more than just an idea where it's going. There's already code guiding the path. With the fundamentals laid out further work on this project means have fun with modular capabilities, more comprehensive forms, and dynamic rendering of an intesive model assocation.
